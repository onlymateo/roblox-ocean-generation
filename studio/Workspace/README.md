# AnimPlane.luau

## Overview
The `AnimPlane.luau` script is designed to animate a plane object within the Roblox environment. It is typically used to create dynamic and visually appealing effects, such as simulating the movement of water, waves, or other fluid-like surfaces.

## Features
- **Plane Animation**: The script applies transformations to a plane object to create smooth, looping animations.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust parameters such as speed, amplitude, and frequency to control the animation's behavior.
- **Performance Optimization**: The script is optimized to ensure smooth performance, even in complex environments.

## How It Works
The script leverages Roblox's rendering and scripting capabilities to modify the plane's properties over time. It uses mathematical functions like sine and cosine to create wave-like motions. These transformations are applied in a loop, ensuring continuous animation.

### Key Components
1. **Initialization**: The script identifies the target plane object and sets up necessary variables.
2. **Animation Loop**: A `while` loop or `RunService` connection is used to update the plane's position or deformation at regular intervals.
3. **Math Functions**: Functions like `math.sin` and `math.cos` are used to calculate the wave patterns.
4. **Customization**: Parameters such as wave speed and height can be adjusted to fit the desired effect.

## Usage
1. Place the `AnimPlane.luau` script in the appropriate location within your Roblox project.
2. Link the script to the plane object you want to animate.
3. Adjust the script's parameters to customize the animation.
4. Run the game to see the animated plane in action.
